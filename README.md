# pyvet: check maintenance status of your python dependencies

http://pyvet.rakhim.org/

Paste a list of python packages (e.g. your `requirements.txt` file or the output of `pip list`), and see the maintenance status of each package:

- claimed supported Python versions (as declared by package metadata)
- Python adoption time (how long it took the package to be updated to specific Python release)
- average release frequency
- total number of releases
- dates of recent releases
- maintenance status (`POOR`, `MODERATE` or `ACTIVE`).
    - `POOR`: package does not support at least the second latest Python release or is not updated in the last 365 days
    - `MODERATE`: package supports at least the second latest Python release and is last updated between 180 and 365 days ago
    - `ACTIVE`: package supports at least the second latest Python release and is last updated less than 180 days ago
